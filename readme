The following is a comprehensive description of Notebooks within this branch, including information about the data.

The Notebooks:
MobileNet_binary -> refers to the binary classification model, inside this notebook: code for binary model, code for model trained on IQ data only, 
code for model considering benign scans, code for Gabor filter for future research

ResNetMod1 -> refers to the initial models including ResNet101V2 model

binary_vgg16_resnet -> refers to the binary models for VGG16 and ResNet50


The data:
CTscns1C –> refers to the processed larger data set with 4 sub folders of 3 NSCLCs and 1 non-cancerous collection
CTscns2C –> refers to the binary data set formed from the larger kaggle data set
BenignCTScns –> refers to the processed IQ data set
CTbenignremoved –> refers to the IQ data set with the benign scans removed from each of the test, train and validation files for binary model
